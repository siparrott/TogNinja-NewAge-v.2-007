# Dual Database Backup Strategy

## Configuration

### Primary Database: New Neon Account  
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_D2bKWziIZj1G@ep-morning-star-a2i1gglu-pooler.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

### Backup Database: Original Replit/Neon
```env
BACKUP_DATABASE_URL=<your-current-database-url>
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Dual Database Support
- Configure both database connections in environment
- Update application to use primary database by default
- Keep backup database accessible for recovery

### 2. Data Migration Process
- Export from backup database (Replit)
- Import to primary database (New Neon)
- Verify data integrity on both databases
- Test application functionality

### 3. Backup Verification Script
```bash
# Verify both databases have same data
node verify-backup-integrity.mjs
```

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Zero Data Loss**: Original data remains untouched on Replit  
✅ **Quick Recovery**: Can switch back instantly if issues occur  
✅ **Safe Testing**: Test new database without risk  
✅ **Business Continuity**: Application keeps running during migration

## Rollback Plan

If any issues with new database:
1. Change DATABASE_URL back to BACKUP_DATABASE_URL  
2. Restart application
3. All original functionality restored

## Post-Migration Cleanup

After successful testing (recommended 1-2 weeks):
1. Archive backup database export
2. Remove BACKUP_DATABASE_URL from environment
3. Keep final export file for historical backup
